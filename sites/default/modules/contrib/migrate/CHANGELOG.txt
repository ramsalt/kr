Migrate 2.1 Beta 1
==================

API change:

Any field handler prepare() or complete() methods you have defined must be changed 
to remove stdClass for the $entity argument. I.e., prepare(stdClass $entity, stdClass $row)
should now be prepare($entity, stdClass $row).

Requirements change:

The migrate_ui submodule now requires the Elements module (http://drupal.org/project/elements)
to support performing operations from the dashboard. Install and enable Elements
before upgrading from Migrate 2.0 to this version if you have migrate_ui enabled.
